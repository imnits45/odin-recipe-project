      Egg dosa is a popular South Indian dish that combines the goodness of
      dosa, a fermented rice and lentil crepe, with the richness of eggs.
    </p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Dosa batter</li>
      <li>Eggs</li>
      <li>Salt</li>
      <li>Oil or ghee (clarified butter)</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <strong>Prepare the dosa batter:</strong> If you haven't already, soak
        rice and lentils (usually a mix of urad dal and rice) for a few hours,
        then grind them into a smooth paste. Ferment this mixture overnight or
        until it's slightly sour.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Heat a skillet:</strong> Place a non-stick skillet or dosa pan
        on medium heat and let it heat up.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Pour the dosa batter:</strong> Once the skillet is hot, pour a
        ladleful of dosa batter onto the center of the skillet. Using the back
        of the ladle, spread the batter in a circular motion to form a thin,
        even layer.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Crack an egg:</strong> Crack an egg directly onto the center of
        the dosa. Be careful not to break the yolk.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Spread the egg:</strong> Using a spatula, gently spread the egg
        over the dosa, being careful not to tear the dosa.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Season with salt:</strong> Sprinkle a pinch of salt over the egg
        to season it.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Drizzle oil or ghee:</strong> Drizzle a little oil or ghee
        around the edges of the dosa and on top of the egg.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Cook until done:</strong> Let the dosa cook on medium heat until
        the edges start to brown and crisp up, and the egg is cooked to your
        desired level of doneness.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Fold and serve:</strong> Once the dosa is cooked, fold it in
        half or roll it up and transfer it to a serving plate.
      </li>
    </ol>
