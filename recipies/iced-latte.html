    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>
      An iced latte is a refreshing coffee beverage that combines espresso with
      chilled milk and ice. It's a popular choice for those looking for a cool
      caffeine fix, especially on hot days
    </p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>1-2 shots of espresso (about 1-2 ounces)</li>
      <li>
        1 cup of cold milk (whole milk, skim milk, almond milk, or any milk of
        your choice)
      </li>
      <li>Ice cubes</li>
      <li>Optional: sweetener of your choice (sugar, honey, syrup, etc.)</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Brew 1-2 shots of espresso using your preferred method. You can use an
        espresso machine, a stovetop espresso maker (moka pot), or even instant
        espresso powder dissolved in hot water.
      </li>
      <li>
        Once the espresso is ready, let it cool for a few minutes to room
        temperature. If you prefer a stronger flavor, use 2 shots of espresso;
        for a milder taste, use 1 shot.
      </li>
      <li>
        While the espresso is cooling, fill a glass with ice cubes. You can use
        as much or as little ice as you like, depending on how strong you want
        your iced latte to be.
      </li>
      <li>Pour the cooled espresso over the ice in the glass.</li>
      <li>
        Next, pour the cold milk into the glass, leaving some space at the top
        for stirring. You can use any type of milk you prefer, and you can
        adjust the amount based on your taste preference. For a creamier latte,
        use more milk; for a stronger coffee flavor, use less milk.
      </li>
      <li>
        If you like your latte sweetened, you can add a sweetener of your choice
        at this point. Stir well to dissolve the sweetener into the latte.
      </li>
      <li>
        Give the iced latte a gentle stir to combine the espresso, milk, and
        ice.
      </li>
      <li>
        Taste the latte and adjust the sweetness or milkiness if necessary.
      </li>
      <li>
        Optional: You can also add flavorings such as vanilla extract, caramel
        syrup, or chocolate syrup for a flavored iced latte.
      </li>
      <li>Serve immediately and enjoy your homemade iced latte!</li>
    </ol>
