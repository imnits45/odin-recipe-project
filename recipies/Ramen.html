    </ul>
    <h3>For the noodles and toppings:</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        4 packs of fresh or dried ramen noodles (or substitute with spaghetti if
        unavailable)
      </li>
      <li>Sliced cooked pork belly, chicken, or tofu (for protein)</li>
      <li>Soft-boiled eggs, halved</li>
      <li>Sliced green onions</li>
      <li>Nori (seaweed sheets), torn into small pieces</li>
      <li>Corn kernels (optional)</li>
      <li>Bamboo shoots (optional)</li>
      <li>Bean sprouts (optional)</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        In a large pot, combine the chicken or pork broth, minced garlic, sliced
        ginger, soy sauce, mirin, and sake. Bring the broth to a simmer over
        medium heat.
      </li>
      <li>
        Once the broth is simmering, reduce the heat to low and let it simmer
        gently for about 30 minutes to allow the flavors to meld together. Taste
        the broth and adjust the seasoning with salt if needed.
      </li>
      <li>
        While the broth is simmering, prepare your toppings. Cook the protein of
        your choice (pork belly, chicken, or tofu) and set aside. Soft-boil the
        eggs, peel them, and halve them. Slice the green onions and prepare any
        other toppings you desire.
      </li>
      <li>
        Cook the ramen noodles according to the package instructions. If using
        fresh noodles, they usually only need to be cooked for a few minutes in
        boiling water. If using dried noodles, follow the cooking time on the
        package.
      </li>
      <li>
        Once the noodles are cooked, drain them and divide them among serving
        bowls.
      </li>
      <li>
        Ladle the hot broth over the noodles in each bowl, making sure to
        distribute the garlic and ginger evenly.
      </li>
      <li>
        Arrange your desired toppings on top of the noodles and broth. This can
        include the cooked protein, soft-boiled eggs, sliced green onions, nori,
        corn kernels, bamboo shoots, and bean sprouts.
      </li>
      <li>Serve the ramen hot and enjoy!</li>
